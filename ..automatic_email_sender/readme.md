In order to run this file and use its functionality you should have these follwing things in you computer :

1) python3 or above ( because python3 syntax hasbeen used )
2) should have smtplib installed (it's already included in standard library in case you don't have it then     install it )
3) active internet connection
4) permessions for less secure apps to access your account so that our python script can access the account 
   (There is another secure way but that will increase the complexity so i'll continue with this)

1) write your email address in place of sender email
2) Then give your password in the password variable 
3) Then in the message section enter the message you want to enter with subject mentioned

    # Note if you are using my test.csv then add email in  mentioned column
6) After adding or provinding a test.csv file give the coloum number in the coloum field in which emials are present for example if you have only added email id's then you will have to give 0 ,
#Example
